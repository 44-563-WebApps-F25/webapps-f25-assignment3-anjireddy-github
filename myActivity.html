    <h2>My Favorite Outdoor Activity: Hiking</h2>
    
    <p>Hiking is my favorite outdoor activity because it offers the perfect combination of <strong>physical exercise</strong> and <strong>mental relaxation</strong>. There's something incredibly peaceful about walking through nature trails, breathing fresh air, and disconnecting from the digital world. I love how hiking challenges me physically while also providing stunning views and opportunities to observe wildlife. Whether it's a leisurely walk through local parks or more challenging mountain trails, hiking always leaves me feeling refreshed and accomplished. The sense of achievement when reaching a summit or completing a difficult trail is unmatched, and the <strong>connection with nature</strong> helps reduce stress and improve my overall well-being.</p>
