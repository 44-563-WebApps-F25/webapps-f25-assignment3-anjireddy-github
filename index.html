    <h2>My Favorite Television Show: Breaking Bad</h2>
    
    <p>Breaking Bad is my favorite television show because of its <strong>incredible storytelling</strong> and complex character development. The show follows Walter White's transformation from a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug kingpin, and the way the writers handle this character arc is absolutely <strong>masterful</strong>. What makes it particularly compelling is how it explores themes of morality, family, and the consequences of our choices. The cinematography and acting performances, especially by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, are truly <strong>exceptional</strong> and make every episode a gripping experience.</p>

    <h2>Code Snippet: Writing JSON Data to File in Python</h2>
    
    <p>This Python code snippet demonstrates how to write data to a JSON file using Python's built-in json module. The function takes any data structure (like a dictionary or list) and saves it to a file in JSON format with proper indentation for readability. This is particularly useful for saving configuration data, API responses, or any structured data that needs to be stored persistently.</p>
    
    <pre>
import json

def write_json_to_file(data, filepath):
	with open(filename, "w") as f:
		json.dump(data, f, indent=4)
    </pre>
