    <h1>Agile Mongoose and Alex</h1>
    
    <h2>Meet My Awesome Superhero Team!</h2>
    <p>So I created this really cool superhero team and there names are <strong>Agile Mongoose</strong> and <strong>Alex</strong>. Agile Mongoose is like super fast - way faster than anyone I know! He can jump around and dodge stuff really quick, kind of like those mongoose animals that fight snakes. I think he's pretty awesome because he never gets hit by the bad guys.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Alex</strong> is the smart one in the team. She's really good with computers and gadgets and stuff. Whenever Agile Mongoose gets into trouble, Alex always knows how to help him out. She makes all these cool inventions that helps them catch the villains. They work really good together!</p>
    
    <p>I think this team is great because one person is really fast and the other one is really smart. Together they can beat almost any bad guy who tries to hurt people in their city. Its like the perfect combination!</p>
